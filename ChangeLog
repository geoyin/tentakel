	  make plugin imports a bit nicer

	   - make the plugin registry a private attribute
	   - error when a plugin class does not inherit from RemoteCommand

2005-03-14 17:11  cran

	* py/lekatnet/remote.py:
	  - add some comments on RemoteCommand.slot to point out the
	  problems

	  - _maxparallel -> __maxparallel

	  - only create the slot semaphore when needed and then only once
	  (this was   a minor bug in the first version)

2005-03-14 15:33  cran

	* py/lekatnet/remote.py:
	  Rework displayAll().

	  Now the RemoteCommand class has an auxiliary queue holding
	  references to objects that have results pending. This way
	  displayAll() can simply wait (blocking) for the next result by
	  calling the auxiliary queues get() method.

	  Makes displayAll() easier to understand and also a bit faster.
	  (speed is getting more and more an issue with tentakel...)

	  As a side effect this also fixes a silly bug that allowed only
	  one command to be executed during an interactive tentakel
	  session.

	  cumulative check-in, cause I made many changes and forgot to

	   - better separation for the *RemoteCommand classes, commandQueue
	     is now semi-private. Leads to easier client interface

	   - fix bug that lead to many stale threads when changing the
	  configuration
	     interactively

	   - RSHRemoteCommand can now determine the rsh return status

	   - attempt to make thread handling better: output results
	  immediately when
	     they're ready (in the resultQueue). For that reason
	  displayAll() sort
	     of polls the resultQueue

	  This commit might break things at first.

	* ChangeLog, README, TODO, tentakel.1, tentakel.1.html,
	  py/tentakel, py/lekatnet/config.py, py/lekatnet/remote.py:
	  Second part of the RemoteCommand overhaul

	   - RemoteCommand is now a generic class, all remote command
	     classes inherit from there

	   - SSHRemoteCommand and RSHRemoteCommand are the first ones

	   - introduce "rsh" method and "rsh_path" variable

	   - update TODO

	   - update manpage

	   - update and reformat README

	   - remove warning message about which config file is used that
	     was there only for debugging reasons

	   - IMPORTANT CHANGE: parameters for a specific hosts are now
	  taken
	     from it's nearest enclosing group and not from the top-level
	  group.
	     A simple change makes this possible: the
	  ConfigBase.getGroupMembers()
	     method now returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains
	  a
	     destination and a complete set of group config parameters

2004-09-26 15:28  cran

	* Makefile, py/setup.py, py/tentakel: crank version number

2004-09-26 15:25  cran

	* py/lekatnet/: config.py, remote.py:
	  First step of the RemoteCommand overhaul:

	  The goal is to have a generic RemoteCommand class and one class
	  for each remote methode that inherits from RemoteCommand.

	   - Unify RemoteCommand __init__ parameters. This way the
	     container object does not need to know about the remote
	     method and its specific parameters. Instead the container
	     has to supply the group specific parameters as a dictionary.

	   - For this it is needed to be able to ask the ConfigBase class
	     for a complete set of configuration directives for a specific
	     group. You can do this with the getGroupParams() method now.

	   - rename: ConfigBase.getExpandedGroup() ->
	  ConfigBase.getGroupMembers()

	   - rename: ConfigBase.getGroup() -> ConfigBase._getGroup()

	   - update docstrings

	   - update unit tests

	  ommited -> omitted)

2003-05-28 00:23  imaginat

	* tentakel: Provided a solution to the problem with the assert
	  function. "set +e" is not supported by many shell, so Sebastians
	  solution wasnt perfect. The ksh and the Unix V7 sh exits for the
	  code "set -e; eval false || true", but it doesnt, when it's
	  wrapped in ``. So I got rid of the set +e and used something
	  similar to "if `eval false`" instead.

2003-04-17 08:45  cran

	* tentakel, tentakel.1: Back out -s option. Setting (format)strings
	  on the commandline is unneeded complexity and we don't really
	  support it yet.

	  This feature may return once we have a working format string
	  expansion facility.

2003-04-17 01:25  imaginat

	* tentakel.1: Take the ENVIRONMENT section out. The only entry
	  there was about DEXECHOST, but that's not in use now, and similar
	  functionality will be implemented in a more abstract way.

2003-04-17 01:17  imaginat

	  function to the setup function.

2003-04-17 00:45  imaginat

	  again.

2003-04-16 18:03  imaginat

	* tentakel: Reporting of the local exit code works now.
	  Unfortunately, for this to work, "set -e" has to be commented
	  out.

	* tentakel: Moved the wait command to the container call method.

2003-04-16 15:48  imaginat

2003-04-16 10:47  cran

	* README, tentakel: Remove lies about the need to quote the remote
	  command in a whole.  This was just a bug that has vanished in the
	  meanwhile.

2003-04-16 10:43  cran

	* README, tentakel, tentakel.1: o Rename flag -c to -l since -c
	  will be used for the global config file.  o Reflect this change
	  in the documentation as well.  o Rename FLAG_CONFIG to
	  FLAG_HOSTLIST for the same reason.

2003-04-16 10:30  cran

	* tentakel: rename parse_config() to parse_hostlist() because we
	  need this name for the function that will parse the global
	  configfile

2003-04-16 10:10  cran

	* tentakel: rename functions to match their meaning better:

	  o callit() becomes distribute_command() o execute() becomes
	  execute_command()

2003-04-16 01:48  imaginat

	* tentakel: Add a class that takes over the repetitive calling of
	  methods of the host objects. Restructure the callit function to
	  make use of this class.  Change make_host to use only one
	  parameter by throwing the currently unused dexechost out. Change
	  the class definition syntax slightly by omitting the semanticly
	  misguiding {} in make_host.

2003-04-16 01:28  imaginat

	* tentakel.1: Due to the OO rewrite the DEXECHOST feature is not
	  implemented at the moment. Note this in the ENVIRONMENT section.

2003-04-14 23:58  imaginat

	* tentakel: The bourne shell doesnt support the unary negation
	  operator !, that negates the return code of pipelines. Remove the
	  only appearance.

2003-04-14 21:20  imaginat

	* tentakel: Introduce a first try on object oriented programming to
	  tentakel.  Rewrite the whole callit function to make use of the
	  new object model for hosts.

	  manpage.

	* README: Take the information about the now obsolete alive check
	  out.

2003-04-12 00:26  imaginat

	* tentakel.1: Update according to the changes in the code (take the
	  aliveness check out).

2003-04-12 00:21  imaginat

	* tentakel: Take the test for aliveness of remote hosts out.  As a
	  result of that, the now useless flags -o and -a have also been
	  removed. -q is the same as -a.

2003-04-11 00:31  cran

	* INSTALL, README, tentakel, tentakel.1: No more nmap. Instead, use
	  ping to determine aliveness of hosts.  Since some implementations
	  of ping don't support setting an explicit timeout value we're
	  bound to the default.

	  Comment two asserts that bugged me while I'm here.

	  functions.

	  ENVIRONMENT

2003-04-09 22:03  imaginat

	* tentakel: Minor corrections / hacks: Ignorance of nmap's stderr,
	  fix a missing "then", include the main program.

2003-04-09 21:50  imaginat

	* tentakel: Introduce the setup function to evaluate the results of
	  the command line parsing. Move the dprint function generation to
	  the setup function.  Introduce the function alive_echo. Moved the
	  setting of the CFGFILE-variable from parse_config to setup.

2003-04-09 21:16  imaginat

	* tentakel: Change parse_options to be just a parser, don't execute
	  any code there.  Removed FLAG_QUIET to conform to documentation
	  to prohibit possible side effects. Removed command line option -h
	  and added --version for displaying version information.

	* tentakel: Added quotes in the dprint function.

2003-04-09 00:17  imaginat

	  Cleaner semanticss for the tests like -eq instead = for numbers.

2003-04-09 00:05  imaginat

	* tentakel.1: Added the "Reporting Bugs" section and my name to the
	  author's list.

2003-04-08 23:53  imaginat

	* tentakel: Removed the unnecessary encapsulation of the nmap|grep
	  pipe in the alive function.

2003-04-08 15:19  imaginat

	* tentakel: Changed the semantics of the tempfile function. Error
	  is now reported through the exit code from the mktemp process
	  itself. The caller doesn't have to check if the created file name
	  is "/dev/null" anymore.

2003-04-08 15:16  imaginat

	* tentakel: Changed the function err to exit by itself after
	  showing the error.  Adapted this behaviour to every places where
	  the err function was used. Introduced the "warn" function to
	  output warnings without exiting.

2003-04-08 15:01  imaginat

	* tentakel: Got rid of the "checksoft" function. It's still too
	  early for such a functionality.
